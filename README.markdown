vim-mfn
=======
My personal vim configuration.

This has grown over the years but I tried to keep it as clean as possible. It
started to get a real project as a joint effort to keep our vim configuration
sane about a few fellow developers.

How to use it
=============
First off: it's usually a *bad* idea to just blindly use somebody else vim
configuration file. You're better off reading the files and cherry picking what
you like.

In case you really want them, either

* with [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/): `git clone https://github.com/mfn/vim-mfn/ ~/.vim/bundle/`
* without: clone the diretory where you want and add this to your `.vimrc`: `set runtimepath+=<dir to vim-mfn>`
